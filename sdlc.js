// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// Note: I'm not clear if you want them simply reordred or to see code that reorders, so here are both.

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const Implementation = ("Implementation makes the software available to users. ")

const Design = ("The way the program looks and acts is developed in the design phase. For the 6-step model, development falls in this catagory.")

const Maintain = ("On ongoing responsiblity to ensure users are supported, the system is maintained, and updates are completed to meet business goals.")

const Analysis = ("Analysis of Requirements requires a deep understanding of software requirements and using that to develop a process diagram.")

const Testing = ('The testing and Integration process deploys all pieces of code, then writing and running test cases to ensure the software performs as expected. ')

const Planning = ("This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.")
